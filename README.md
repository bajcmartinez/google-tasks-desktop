Open source UI that connects to your Google Tasks account and it's intended to be an additional interface for the service for desktop applications, and to bring a full web experience over Google Tasks. It's not intended to replace existing Google Tasks solutions but to complement them.

This app is not affiliated, sponsored or developed by Google by any means, it's a hobby project that some people seem to be liking and using. I do not plan on charging, nor collecting metrics or any type of data from the use of this app.
This app connects to the Google Tasks API which privacy policies can be found here [Google API Privacy Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy).
Our servers only host the front-end application and you browser does not send any of your private information to our servers, all communications are done directly from the browser to the Google APIs.
